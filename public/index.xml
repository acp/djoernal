I really hope that this journal will be the last one that I make. I&amp;rsquo;ve created probably more than five journals and most of them are only filled with hello world posts. So hopefully, this is the last one.
Also, you might wonder why the name of this site is Djoernal, well the Van Ophuijsen spelling is one of my interest since I kinda like how it looks sophisticated.</description></item></channel></rss>
