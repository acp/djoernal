## ðŸ‘‹ Hi! I'm a 14-year-old developer & technopreneur from Jakarta, Indonesia.

I have tons of repositories/websites filled with scattered content so this is my attempt on combining those contents.

Besides doing schoolwork as a student and writing codes as a develoepr, I want to try writing about stuffs that's happening in my actual life. Probably not the ones related to politics though. I'd rather write lists and movie/music reviews.
