## ðŸ‘‹ Hi there, I'm Andre.

I have tons of repositories / websites / blogs / journals scattered with contents all around, so this is my attempt on combining them.

Besides doing schoolwork as a student and writing codes as a developer, I want to try writing about stuffs that's happening in my actual life. Probably not the ones related to politics though. I'd rather write lists and movie/music reviews.
