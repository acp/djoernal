title: "Coming Up With Names"
---

The name of my software house, `Wacktoo` actually came to my mind when I was reading this one article about how 
Stephen Hawking fights the Religion Dogma.

One of the sentences from the article was 
`Hawking's distrust of religion originated from the zeitgeist era of the 1960s`

The word `zeitgeist` reminded me of the company, ZEIT, which means time in German, 
I then think of naming my company Waktu, 
but then I realized that the name would probably be hard to spell and the usernames for it are taken. 
I then thought of using an alternative spelling for it, `Wacktoo`.

It would sound the same, 
but this one actually had both the Twitter & GitHub usernames avaialable for it, 
and it looked funnier.

### Conclusion

Well I guess one way to find a name would be by reading any articles, not just tech articles. 
~You could also find a name such as Aviato by getting stoned but I wouldn't recommend that.~
